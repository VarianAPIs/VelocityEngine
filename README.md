# VelocityEngine

## Requirements 
VelocityEngine requires a Velocity system and valid license. Use
of the VelocityEngine is governed by the Velocity license. VelocityEngine may be
used with either a local Velocity workstation system, in a single-user fashion,
or the VelocityGRID server system, remotely. Users of the VelocityEngine must
have a user of type "script" created on the Velocity system. Only one login per
script user is possible on a workstation system. Users of the VelocityGRID
system may have unlimited logins using a single script user - however each login
will consume a license.

## Non-Clinical Use 
VelocityEngine has not been tested and validated for
clinical use on humans. It requires a non-clinical system. VelocityEngine checks
at login to verify the system is a non-clinical database.

## License 
Copyright 2021 Varian Medical Systems, inc. Use of the VelocityEngine
is governed by existing license of Velocity software. No additional warranties
are provided. Use at your own risk.
